# convert
Convert the different encoding formats to utf-8
In daily work, the encoding format of many files is not standard UTF-8, So this tool can be used to convert formats from others(like gbk or gb2312, it's a Chinese encoding format) to UTF-8.
It's very simple to use, just like
```python convery.py file```
